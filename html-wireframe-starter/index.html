           <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
             I am a creative problem solver that enjoys coding, reading, watching movies, and traveling. As a student at Thinkful, I have learned to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Thinkful has also taught me to be a life long learner and to be comfortable with the comfortable. Currently, I reside in Evans, GA with my hushand and son. I am looking for a job that affords me the opportunity to be creative, problem-solve and most importantly, code.
